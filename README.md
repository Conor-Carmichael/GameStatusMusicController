# Gaming Spotify Controller

When playing video games, it would be nice to have spotify automatically controlled based on game state. An example is Valorant(, or Counter Strike)- When I am playing Valorant I like my music to be paused during the round, play after I die, play during the buy phase, etc. The goal of this project is to enable that by taking classifying game state from the state of the screen.#GameStatusMediaController
